    <!-- INTRO -->
    <section class="section">
      <p class="content-narrow">
        Most packaging problems do not start in production.
        They start earlier — in structure selection, artwork setup,
        or unverified regulatory assumptions.
      </p>

      <p class="content-narrow">
        Our development approach focuses on identifying these risks
        before mass production begins, turning manufacturing into a
        confirmation step rather than a correction phase.

      <h2>What We Control During Development</h2>

      <div class="grid grid-2">
        <Card>
          <h3>Structural Feasibility</h3>
          <p>
            Dieline accuracy, material compatibility,
            barrier selection, and sealing integrity
            aligned with product sensitivity and filling method.
          </p>
        </Card>

        <Card>
          <h3>Artwork & Template Accuracy</h3>
          <p>
            Controlled production templates that prevent
            barcode distortion, misalignment,
            and finishing tolerance errors.
          </p>
        </Card>

        <Card>
          <h3>Regulatory Review</h3>
          <p>
            Early verification of warning areas,
            labeling space allocation,
            and traceability placement.
          </p>
        </Card>

        <Card>
          <h3>Cost & Scalability Planning</h3>
          <p>
            Format and material decisions evaluated
            not only by unit price,
            but by long-term SKU expansion and logistics efficiency.

          <h3>Technical Intake Review</h3>
          <p>
            We assess product weight, sensitivity,
            distribution channels, and target markets
            before proposing structure.

          <p>
            Recommended format and material stack
            based on protection requirements,
            retail format, and cost targets.

          <p>
            Production-ready templates prepared

          <span class="workflow-step">04</span>
          <h3>Pilot Validation Before Scaling</h3>
          <p>
            Small-batch verification of seal strength,
            structural durability, and visual alignment
            before committing to volume production.

    <!-- WHY THIS APPROACH WORKS -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Why This Development Approach Reduces Risk</h2>

      <div class="content-narrow">
        <p>
          Packaging delays are often caused by late-stage
          artwork corrections, structural miscalculations,
          or compliance adjustments after tooling begins.
        </p>

        <p>
          By verifying structure, templates, and labeling
          before mass production,
          we reduce emergency revisions,
          freight waste, and timeline disruption.

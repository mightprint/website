    <!-- Strategic Positioning -->
    <section class="section">
      <p class="content-narrow">
        Most packaging suppliers focus only on manufacturing. Our Packaging
        Development System integrates structural engineering, compliance
        foresight, designer collaboration, and production optimization into one
        coordinated workflow.

      <h2>Why This System Matters</h2>

      <p class="content-narrow">
        Packaging failures often originate from structural oversight,
        non-standard templates, or late-stage compliance corrections. Our system
        minimizes rework, shortens development cycles, and ensures predictable
        production outcomes.

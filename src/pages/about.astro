    <!-- WHO WE ARE -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p class="system-intro">
        Founded in 2014 in Dongguan, China, Might Print operates as a
        structured packaging system manufacturer serving international brands.
        Our focus extends beyond production — we emphasize structural clarity,
        process control, and repeatable performance.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SYSTEM PHILOSOPHY -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Our System Philosophy</h2>
      <p class="system-intro">
        We believe packaging stability begins before machines start running.
        Structural assumptions, artwork governance, and production validation
        must be aligned early in development.
      </p>
      <p>
        This philosophy forms the foundation of our
        Structured Packaging Development System —
        a framework that reduces revision cycles and improves delivery predictability.

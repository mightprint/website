        Retail-ready packaging is a structured packaging system designed to
        meet regulatory requirements, protect product integrity, and ensure
        efficient retail distribution. In regulated industries such as nicotine,
        cannabis derivatives, and nutraceuticals, packaging is not decoration -
        it is infrastructure.

      <h2>Why Retail-Ready Packaging Matters in Regulated Industries</h2>

      <div class="content-narrow">
        <p>
          In regulated categories, packaging functions as risk management.
          Non-compliant structures or incorrect labeling can result in retail
          rejection, customs delays, or forced redesign.
        </p>

        <p>
          If your packaging is not retail-ready, your product is not
          retail-ready.

        <Card>
          <h3>Step 2 - Define Protection Needs</h3>
          <p>
            Assess sensitivity to moisture, oxygen, UV exposure, and structural
            fragility.

      <h2>Retail-Ready Packaging FAQs</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is retail-ready packaging mandatory?</h3>
        <p>
          In regulated industries, compliance elements such as child-resistant
          structures and warning labels are legally required in many regions.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What is the difference between retail-ready and shelf-ready packaging?</h3>
        <p>
          Shelf-ready packaging focuses on display efficiency, while
          retail-ready packaging includes compliance, structural protection,
          branding, and distribution logic.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How much does retail-ready packaging cost?</h3>
        <p>
          Costs vary depending on material type, compliance requirements,
          barrier complexity, and order volume. A system-based approach reduces
          redesign expenses long term.

      <h2>Structure and Compliance</h2>

      <p style="max-width: 760px;">
        Display boxes are typically used as outer packaging and do not come
        into direct contact with food or consumable products. Inner boxes or
        primary packaging are used to protect the product itself. All structures
        are designed to meet export handling and logistics requirements.

    <div class="container section-center">
      <p class="content-narrow strong-text">
        Packaging is not a single format.

      <h2>Multi-Layer Packaging Architecture</h2>
      <p class="content-narrow">
        Regulated products require alignment across every structural layer —
        from primary barrier containment to secondary carton stability
        and retail-ready presentation.
        Each layer performs independently, yet functions as part of one unified system.

## What Are Display Boxes?

Display boxes are folding paperboard boxes designed to present products directly on retail shelves or countertops. Made primarily from white cardboard (IVC), these boxes are lightweight, foldable, and cost-efficient.

They are widely used in supermarkets and retail stores to enhance product visibility and improve impulse purchasing.

## Material & Structure

Most of our display boxes are produced using high-quality white cardboard (IVC). This material provides:

- Smooth surface for premium printing
- Excellent stiffness for shelf stability
- Cost-efficient production
- Easy folding for transport and storage

Compared with rigid boxes, folding cartons use less material, involve fewer production processes, and significantly reduce packaging costs.

## Why Display Boxes Are Cost-Effective

### 1. Foldable Design
Display boxes are delivered flat-packed, which reduces shipping volume and lowers transportation costs.

### 2. Low Material Consumption
Made from single-layer paperboard, production costs are lower compared to rigid or corrugated boxes.

### 3. Fast Production
Simplified manufacturing process allows shorter lead time.

### 4. Lower MOQ
Ideal for growing brands and new product launches.

## Designed to Pair with Stand Up Pouches

Display boxes are frequently used together with flexible packaging products such as stand up pouches.

For example:

- Snack pouches displayed in countertop display boxes
- Coffee pouches arranged in retail display trays
- Supplement pouches placed in branded shelf boxes

This combination improves retail organization and enhances brand presence.

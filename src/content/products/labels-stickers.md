## Labels vs Stickers: What Is the Difference?

Labels and stickers are both adhesive printed materials, but they are often used with different priorities.

In practical packaging workflows:

- **Labels** are usually information-driven, attached to products for branding, ingredients, compliance, and usage details.
- **Stickers** are often promotion-driven, used for campaigns, giveaways, decoration, or temporary brand messaging.

Many projects combine both in one product system.

## Why Labels & Stickers Are a High-Value Category

### 1. Fast and Flexible Production
Compared with rigid packaging components, labels and stickers have a shorter and simpler production cycle.

### 2. Lower Total Cost
Material usage is low, process flow is efficient, and logistics cost is minimal due to lightweight shipment.

### 3. Easy SKU Expansion
Brands can quickly launch variants (flavor, size, seasonal campaign) by updating label artwork without changing bottle molds.

### 4. Strong Retail and E-commerce Utility
Labels and stickers support both regulatory information and visual branding across online and offline channels.

## What is a Three Side Seal Pouch?

A three side seal pouch is a flat flexible package sealed on the left, right, and bottom (or top) edges, leaving one side for filling and final sealing. It is one of the most widely used pouch formats due to its simple structure and production efficiency.

Because it uses less material than stand-up formats, this pouch type is often preferred for cost-sensitive products and large-volume runs.

## Key Advantages

### 1. Cost Efficiency
The simplified structure reduces film usage and manufacturing complexity, making three side seal pouches more economical for high-volume orders.

### 2. Compact and Space-Saving
Flat pouches are easy to stack, carton-pack, and transport, helping optimize warehouse and shipping efficiency.

### 3. High Production Speed
This format is compatible with automated filling and sealing lines, supporting stable output and shorter turnaround.

### 4. Strong Barrier Options
With proper laminated films, three side seal pouches can provide excellent protection against moisture, oxygen, and light.

## Typical Limitations

Compared with stand up pouches, three side seal pouches cannot stand on shelves by themselves. For retail display, they are often used together with display boxes or dispenser cartons.

## FAQ

### Are three side seal pouches suitable for liquids?
They are mainly used for powders, granules, and small-dose products. For liquids, structure selection and sealing design need to be evaluated case by case.

### Can I customize pouch dimensions and printing?
Yes. We provide full customization for dimensions, film structure, thickness, and artwork printing.

### How do I choose between stand up pouch and three side seal pouch?
If your priority is cost and compact size, three side seal is usually better. If shelf standing display is critical, stand up pouch is often the better option.

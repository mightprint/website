## What Are Dispenser Boxes?

Dispenser boxes are folding paperboard boxes designed for controlled product dispensing. Unlike standard display boxes, dispenser boxes feature a front opening, perforation, or tear-off panel that allows consumers to easily remove one unit at a time.

They are widely used in supermarkets, pharmacies, and convenience stores.

## Structural Advantage

The main structural difference between display boxes and dispenser boxes lies in the opening mechanism.

Dispenser boxes include:

- Front tear-open panels
- Perforated dispensing windows
- Reinforced bottom for stability
- Optional inner support structures

This makes them ideal for organized product distribution in retail environments.

## Cost-Effective Folding Carton Solution

Like other folding cartons, dispenser boxes are:

- Made from white cardboard (IVC)
- Foldable and flat-packed for shipping
- Lower in cost compared to rigid boxes
- Faster to produce
- Suitable for medium to large volume retail supply

---

## Perfect Companion for Stand Up Pouches

Dispenser boxes are often paired with stand up pouches and sachets.

For example:

- Small snack pouches arranged in dispensing cartons
- Coffee sachets organized in countertop dispenser boxes
- Supplement packs distributed one-by-one

This system improves shelf organization and enhances customer experience.

Stand up pouches are one of the most popular flexible packaging solutions in modern retail markets. Featuring a bottom gusset that allows the pouch to stand upright, this packaging format enhances shelf visibility and improves consumer convenience.

Compared to traditional flat bags, stand up pouches offer stronger stability, better presentation, and greater storage efficiency.

Gummies and powdered supplements have become one of the fastest-growing product categories in North America and Europe.  
However, many brands underestimate how critical **packaging choice** is for product stability, shelf life, compliance, and customer perception.

This guide explains how to choose the right packaging for gummies and supplements from a **manufacturer’s perspective**, not just a marketing one.

## 1. Understand Your Product Characteristics

Before selecting any packaging, clarify these key factors:

- **Form**: gummies, powder, capsules, tablets
- **Sensitivity**: moisture, oxygen, light, heat
- **Serving size** and daily usage
- **Shelf life requirements**

For gummies in particular, moisture and temperature control are the most critical concerns. Poor packaging can lead to sticking, deformation, or texture changes during storage and shipping.


## 2. Choose the Right Packaging Material

Flexible packaging is the most common choice due to cost efficiency and good barrier performance.

Typical structures include:

- PET / PE
- PET / AL / PE (with aluminum foil)
- BOPP / CPP
- Custom laminated structures based on barrier needs

### When to Use Aluminum Foil Layers

Aluminum foil is recommended if:

- The product is sensitive to **moisture and oxygen**
- Long-distance export shipping is required
- Shelf life expectations exceed 12 months

Foil layers provide excellent barrier properties but increase cost slightly. For premium or regulated products, this trade-off is usually worthwhile.


## 3. Select the Right Pouch Format

The most commonly used pouch types for gummies and supplements include:

### Stand-up Pouches (Doypack)
- Most popular option
- Good shelf presence
- Suitable for retail and e-commerce

### Flat Bottom Pouches
- Premium appearance
- Better stability on shelves
- Higher material and production cost

### Three-Side Seal Bags
- Cost-effective for single-serve or sample packs
- Common for sachets and trial sizes

Choosing the right format depends on **branding position, order volume, and budget**.


## 4. Consider Zippers, Child-Resistant Features, and Compliance

Depending on your target market and product type, you may need:

- **Resealable zippers** for multi-use products
- **Child-resistant zippers** (especially for cannabinoid-related gummies)
- **Tear notches** for easy opening
- Compliance with FDA, CPSR, or regional regulations

Packaging should be discussed together with your legal or compliance team before mass production.


## 5. Printing Quality and Color Accuracy

For supplement brands, packaging is often the **first physical touchpoint** with consumers.

Key printing considerations:

- Color consistency across reorders
- Readability of nutrition facts and dosage information
- Matte vs glossy finish
- Resistance to scuffing during transportation

A reliable supplier should be able to maintain **stable colors across different production batches**, even when equipment or production schedules change.


## 6. Balance Cost, MOQ, and Lead Time

When choosing packaging, consider:

- Minimum order quantity (MOQ)
- Unit cost at different quantities
- Production lead time
- Shipping method and destination

Lower-cost packaging may appear attractive initially but can lead to higher long-term costs due to quality issues or reprints.


## 7. Work With a Manufacturer, Not Just a Printer

The best packaging solutions come from suppliers who understand:

- Export logistics
- Material performance
- Regulatory requirements
- Long-term repeat production

Early communication about your product and market can prevent costly mistakes later.


## Final Thoughts

Choosing the right packaging for gummies and supplements is not just a design decision — it is a **product quality and brand trust decision**.

Investing time upfront to select appropriate materials, structures, and suppliers will help ensure consistent quality, compliance, and customer satisfaction.

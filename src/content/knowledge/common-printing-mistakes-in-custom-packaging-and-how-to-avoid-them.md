Custom packaging projects often look straightforward on screen, but many issues only appear **after printing has started**.  
From color inconsistencies to layout errors, small mistakes can lead to costly reprints, delays, and disputes.

Based on real production experience, this article outlines the most common printing mistakes in custom packaging — and how to avoid them.

## 1. Assuming Screen Colors Will Match Printed Colors

One of the most common misunderstandings is expecting printed colors to look exactly the same as they do on a computer screen.

**Why this happens:**
- Screens display colors using RGB
- Printing uses CMYK inks
- Different printing machines and materials affect color appearance

**How to avoid it:**
- Always design in CMYK color mode
- Request a printed color proof when color accuracy is critical
- Accept a reasonable tolerance range for mass production

Understanding color limitations early can prevent unnecessary disputes later.

## 2. Ignoring Material Impact on Printing Results

The same artwork can look very different when printed on different materials.

Common factors include:
- Glossy vs matte film
- Paperboard vs laminated surfaces
- Presence of aluminum foil layers

**How to avoid it:**
- Confirm final material structure before artwork approval
- Ask for sample photos or physical samples printed on similar materials
- Avoid last-minute material changes after design approval

Material selection should always be finalized **before** color confirmation.

## 3. Placing Critical Text Too Close to Cutting Lines

Important information such as batch numbers, nutrition facts, or warnings is sometimes placed too close to trim or fold lines.

**Why this is risky:**
- Minor cutting deviations are normal in mass production
- Folding and gluing can slightly shift positions

**How to avoid it:**
- Follow dieline safety margins strictly
- Keep critical text away from edges and folds
- Review dielines carefully before approving artwork

This is especially important for regulated products.

## 4. Overlooking Small Text Readability

Designs often look clean on screen, but small text may become difficult to read after printing.

Common issues include:
- Thin fonts
- Light colors on dark backgrounds
- Small font sizes on textured materials

**How to avoid it:**
- Avoid extremely thin fonts for mandatory information
- Increase font size slightly for regulatory text
- Print test samples when readability is critical

Readability should never be sacrificed for visual style.

## 5. Forgetting Consistency Across Variants

For product lines with multiple flavors or variants, inconsistencies can easily occur.

Typical mistakes:
- Incorrect batch numbers
- Mismatched flavor names
- Different color tones across variants

**How to avoid it:**
- Create a clear master artwork reference
- Double-check variable elements separately
- Use a structured approval process for each SKU

Small inconsistencies can cause big issues in retail environments.

## 6. Rushing Artwork Approval to Meet Deadlines

Tight timelines often lead to rushed approvals, increasing the risk of errors.

**How to avoid it:**
- Allocate sufficient time for artwork review
- Involve both design and production teams
- Treat artwork approval as a final checkpoint, not a formality

Fixing issues before printing is always cheaper than correcting them afterward.

## Final Thoughts

Most printing mistakes are not caused by lack of effort, but by lack of **production awareness** during the design stage.

Working with an experienced packaging manufacturer who understands materials, printing processes, and export requirements can significantly reduce risks and ensure smoother production.
